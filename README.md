# Predditor
Predditor is not as scary as it sounds. It is a simple Deno subreddit watcher, that has the ability to automatically message posters based on a user-defined set of keywords.  

The usecase that I created it for was a to watch a swapping subreddit for certain items and let the posters know that I was interested in their item.

Predditor could be used for a variety of botting or moderating purposes as well.
